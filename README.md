# TransparentRank Lab: information retrieval for Joachims-Aligned Research

A professor-outreach research proposal aligned with **Thorsten Joachims** at **Cornell University**.

## For Professor Outreach

This repo is intended to support an honest outreach email. It contains a concrete proposal for what value you can add, but it does **not** yet contain completed experiments or results.

Start here:

- `outreach/value_add_packet.md` - professor-specific contribution plan.
- `outreach/email_draft.md` - short mail draft you can personalize before sending.
- `docs/one_page_project_plan.md` - one-page project summary.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - clear statement of what exists and what does not exist yet.


## Runnable Value-Add Code

This repo now contains a working starter artifact in `src/value_add.py`.

```bash
python src/value_add.py --write-report reports/demo_results.json
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The code runs a `retrieval`-specific audit over `data/value_add_examples.csv` using professor metadata from `data/advisor_profile.json`. The sample data is intentionally small and honest; replace it with real public/lab-relevant data before making research claims.

See `docs/value_add_implementation.md` for the exact value-add path.

## Research Question

How can a focused, reproducible artifact around **information retrieval** create useful research infrastructure for a lab working on **ML, information retrieval, learning-to-rank, SVMs**?

## Advisor Fit

- **Professor:** Thorsten Joachims
- **University:** Cornell University
- **Program:** Computer Science
- **CSV research area:** ML, information retrieval, learning-to-rank, SVMs
- **Representative paper:** Optimizing Search Engines using Clickthrough Data; 2002; KDD
- **Scholar link:** https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Optimizing+Search+Engines+using+Clickthrough+Data

## Proposed Research-Grade Deliverable

Build **a transparent ranking or recommendation system with user-controllable evidence** with:

- Baseline ranking system with reproducible metrics.
- Control/explanation module with ablations.
- Preference-drift or counterfactual evaluation.
- Report on quality-control tradeoffs.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Repository Map

- `outreach/value_add_packet.md` - value-add plan for this professor.
- `outreach/email_draft.md` - email draft; personalize before sending.
- `docs/research_brief.md` - project hypothesis, novelty, methods, and evaluation plan.
- `docs/one_page_project_plan.md` - one-page project summary.
- `docs/experiment_plan.md` - baseline, ablation, and reporting protocol.
- `configs/baseline.yaml` - first experiment configuration placeholder.
- `reproducibility/commands.md` - exact commands and environment notes.
- `data/source_programs.csv` - original CSV for traceability.

## Status

Proposal scaffold only. Before external use, verify the professor's current lab page and make a selected repo public or shareable.
